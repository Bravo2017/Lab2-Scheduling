# Lab2-Scheduling
In this lab I simulate scheduling in order to see how the time required depends on the scheduling algorithm and the request patterns.
To run this program, in terminal, navigate to the package and do the following 
--$ javac scheduler/Scheduler.java
--$ java scheduler.Scheduler (optional verbose flag)(absolute path of text file)
